4th strategy: Attempts to solve both problems that appeared in the 3rd strategy, the wrong turn when the robot loses
its opponent in the field of vision and the 'immobility' caused by the frontal encounter of the two robots. Initially,
the robot rotates until it detects the opponent and when it does, it moves in front of it. If it has been idle for a long
time, it turns slightly to escape from this position. This is accomplished with the help of a counter that increases as 
the robot remains idle and if it exceeds a certain value, it changes the behavior of the robot. We also use a variable as
a flag bit to know if the robots have met or not. If this value is equal to one, then we consider that they have met before
and the robot turns in the opposite direction than before, so that it can locate the robot directly. This way it can save
time and push it as long as it cannot resist because it has not yet detected it.

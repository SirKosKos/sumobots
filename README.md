This is a test simulation for my thesis at Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of University of Patras, Greece. The two robots move according to 4 different strategies. The are able to detect each other using a camera placed on the top them which is used to determine whether the blue/green color (it depends on the opponent) is present or not. The environment is the simplest possible (everything is white) so the only other detectable color is the opponent's color. The bounds of the battle area are set by the black line. The simulation ends when the center of a robot's mass (uniform distribution) is out of bounds.

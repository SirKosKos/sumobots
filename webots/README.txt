folder and paste it at the cameraK controller. If you select a world that has 2-wheel robots then if the robot is
blue-colored you pick on of the strategies from the folder "blue wheels2" and paste it at cameraA controller. If its
a green one then you select a strategy from "green wheels2" folder and paste it at cameraK controller.

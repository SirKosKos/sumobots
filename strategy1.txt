1st strategy: After the detection, the opponent is approached with a zigzag. As soon as the opponent is found, the rotation continues (counterclockwise). For a given time the robot is moving forward. It then rotates about 90 degrees but in the opposite direction to the previous one (ie clockwise) and moves forward again. After some time, a new 90-degree counterclockwise rotation is made, and another forward move too. This process is constantly repeated. The main idea of ​​this strategy is, first of all, to fool the opponent as to what our true course is. Also, when the two robots come into contact if these moves are made, we will exercise different forces at regular intervals. That way, we'll have a better chance of changing the balance of the opponent's robot and either turning it around or getting off the ground.

2nd strategy: After identifying the opponent, the robot implementing this strategy moves forward. Then, it makes a right turn and a little later moves left but also forward provided that the opponent is in its field of vision. The difference with strategy 1 is (other than the initial frontal movement) that here it does not rotate around itself and then move forward but as it moves straight it changes its course to the right at the beginning and then to the left. The goal is to hit the opponent's robot not as frontally but as sideways as possible. In this way we will gain an advantage over a robot moving in front of us.
